Most people on Earth have probably heard of the movie The Matrix. The Matrix series is one of the most popular movies in the world. The most important factor in the success of all media outlets like books, movies, and dramas depends on how well the first work in the series captured the audience. The Wachowski sisters' Matrix 1 is a movie with many philosophical messages and fun at the same time. And many of the philosophical messages and ideas contained in the matrix are based on Descartes' book Meditations on First Philosophy in which are demonstrated the existence of God and the distinction between the human soul and body> (Meditation). Therefore, in order to truly understand the film, it is important to examine the relationship between The Matrix and the Meditation. They present Descartes' ideas to the audience through various methods such as dialogue, action, and items.
